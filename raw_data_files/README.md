This folder is part of the necessary directory structure if you want to test the code. It also contains all of the raw data files from the project.
Here you will find raw data files associated with the research projects. They have been organized as follows:

Experiments are labeled as numbers. Transfers indicate the F1 mother to lay eggs after post mating.

- SNP genotyping consists of transfers of 48 hours for 10 days. The temperature variation is between 18°C/23°C.


- Pilot 1 consist of transfers of 120 hours for 20 days. The temperature variation is between 18°C/25°C.


- Pilot 2 consist of transfers of 48h  for 10 days. The temperature variation is between 18°C/24.5°C.


- Experiment 1 consist of transfers of 48h  for 6 days and 72h for 6-15 days. The temperature variation is between 18°C/25°C.


- Experiment 2 consist of transfers of 72h  for 12 days. The temperature variation is between 21°C/26°C.


- Experiment 3 consist of transfers of 24h  for 6-10 days. The temperature variation is between 21°C/26°C.


- Experiment 4 consist of transfers of 72h  for 12 days. The treatment variation is between age and control.
