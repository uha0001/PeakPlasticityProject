This folder consists of the R markdown demonstration of the experiment 3 code separated from the master script. The purpose of this demonstration is to familirize the reader with
the code and give an idea of what to expect in general analysis of recombination rate. 

This section includes two files:
1. Rmarkdown format, it can be run in R just like the code.
The code needs to be in the same folder as the datasets. 

2. html file that needs to be downloaded to see the final version of the analysis including the odd ratio, recombination rate and fecundity graphs. and statistics in order to
complete the ANOVA and follow up post hoc analysis in both recombination rate and fecundity analysis.
